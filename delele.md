Django REST Framework, often abbreviated as "Django RestAPI," is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs in Django. Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.




Django REST Framework is a powerful, feature-rich toolkit that makes it easy to build Web APIs in Django. It has many advantages, which makes it one of the top choices for building RESTful APIs. Here are some key points that make Django REST Framework so useful:

Browsable API: One of the key features of Django REST Framework is its ability to create web-browsable APIs. This means that the API has its own client interface, which can be viewed via a web browser. This is a great tool for debugging and testing during development.

Serialization: Django REST Framework provides a powerful serialization engine which supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources. The serializers in Django REST Framework work very similarly to Django's Form and ModelForm classes. You can create, update, and delete instances using serializers.

Authentication & permissions: Django REST Framework provides flexible methods for authenticating the user by using token-based authentication or using Django's session authentication. It also provides a simple way to define permissions on your API views, from basic permission (like authenticated users only) to more complex permission rules.

Throttling: This feature controls the rate of request that client can make to the API. It is a safety measure to prevent the server from being overwhelmed by too many requests.

Pagination: Django REST Framework handles paginating responses and controlling the maximum amount of items per page.

Versioning: This allows different versions of the API to be deployed at the same time, enabling older clients to still interact with the system.

ViewSets and Routers: The ViewSets in Django REST Framework provide operations such as retrieve, or list, and you can use them without having to write explicit views. Routers generate URL patterns for your API views, reducing the amount of code you need to write.

Exception handling: Django REST Framework provides a simple mechanism to handle exceptions and customize the error responses that are returned to the clients.

We use Django REST Framework because it makes it easier to build robust, scalable, and secure RESTful APIs. It builds upon the core features of Django, adding a layer of conventions and tools for structuring views and data, leading to more readable and maintainable code. In addition, the ability to browse the API, use various authentication schemes, handle errors consistently, and add customizable business logic makes it a powerful tool for any Django developer.
